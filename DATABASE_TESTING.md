## üß™ **Complete Testing Procedures**

### **1. Database Connection Test**
```bash
# Test Supabase connection
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Should return:
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-25T...",
  "uptime": 123.456,
  "environment": "development"
}
```

### **2. User Registration & Authentication Test**
```bash
# Test user registration
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@docme.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "fullName": "Test User"
  }'

# Expected response:
{
  "user": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "email": "test@docme.com",
    "fullName": "Test User"
  },
  "session": { ... }
}
```

### **3. Payment System Test**
```bash
# Test order creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/payment/subscription/create-order \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "planType": "pro",
    "billingCycle": "monthly"
  }'

# Expected response:
{
  "orderId": "order_...",
  "amount": 199000,
  "currency": "INR",
  "key": "rzp_test_..."
}
```

### **4. File Conversion Test**
```bash
# Test file conversion
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/conversion/convert \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@test.txt" \
  -F "targetFormat=pdf" \
  -F "aiEnhanced=true"

# Expected response:
{
  "conversionId": "uuid",
  "status": "pending",
  "message": "Conversion started successfully"
}
```

### **5. Database Integrity Tests**

#### **Test User Data Isolation (RLS)**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- This should only return data for the authenticated user
SELECT * FROM users WHERE auth.uid() = id;
SELECT * FROM conversions WHERE auth.uid() = user_id;
SELECT * FROM payments WHERE auth.uid() = user_id;
```

#### **Test Foreign Key Constraints**
```sql
-- Test referential integrity
SELECT 
  u.email,
  s.plan_type,
  s.status,
  p.amount,
  p.status as payment_status
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN subscriptions s ON u.id = s.user_id
LEFT JOIN payments p ON s.id = p.subscription_id
WHERE u.email = 'test@docme.com';
```

#### **Test Automatic Functions**
```sql
-- Test invoice number generation
INSERT INTO invoices (user_id, amount, currency, status)
VALUES ('your-user-id', 199000, 'INR', 'draft');

-- Check if invoice_number was auto-generated
SELECT invoice_number FROM invoices ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
-- Should return: INV-2025-000001
```

### **6. Performance Tests**

#### **Index Performance Test**
```sql
-- Test query performance with indexes
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM conversions 
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 20;

-- Should show index usage and fast execution
```

#### **Concurrent User Test**
```bash
# Test multiple simultaneous users
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/signup \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"email\":\"user$i@test.com\",\"password\":\"password123\",\"fullName\":\"User $i\"}" &
done
wait
```

### **7. Data Validation Tests**

#### **Test Data Constraints**
```sql
-- Test plan_type constraints
INSERT INTO users (email, plan_type) 
VALUES ('invalid@test.com', 'invalid_plan');
-- Should fail with constraint violation

-- Test subscription status constraints
INSERT INTO subscriptions (user_id, plan_type, status, amount) 
VALUES ('user-id', 'pro', 'invalid_status', 199000);
-- Should fail with constraint violation
```

#### **Test Required Fields**
```sql
-- Test NOT NULL constraints
INSERT INTO conversions (user_id, source_format, target_format) 
VALUES ('user-id', 'pdf', 'docx');
-- Should fail because original_filename and file_size are required
```

### **8. Cleanup and Maintenance Tests**

#### **Test Automatic Cleanup Function**
```sql
-- Test expired file cleanup
SELECT cleanup_expired_files();

-- Verify expired conversions marked as failed
SELECT status, error_message FROM conversions 
WHERE expires_at < now() AND status IN ('pending', 'processing');
```

#### **Test Trigger Functions**
```sql
-- Test updated_at trigger
UPDATE users SET full_name = 'Updated Name' WHERE email = 'test@docme.com';

-- Check if updated_at was automatically set
SELECT full_name, updated_at FROM users WHERE email = 'test@docme.com';
```

## üìä **Database Monitoring**

### **Key Metrics to Monitor**
```sql
-- User growth
SELECT DATE(created_at) as date, COUNT(*) as new_users
FROM users 
GROUP BY DATE(created_at) 
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Conversion volume
SELECT DATE(created_at) as date, COUNT(*) as conversions
FROM conversions 
GROUP BY DATE(created_at) 
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Revenue tracking
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  SUM(amount)/100 as revenue_inr,
  COUNT(*) as transactions
FROM payments 
WHERE status = 'captured'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at) 
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Plan distribution
SELECT plan_type, COUNT(*) as users
FROM users 
GROUP BY plan_type;
```

### **Performance Monitoring**
```sql
-- Check table sizes
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  attname,
  n_distinct,
  correlation
FROM pg_stats 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Monitor slow queries
SELECT query, mean_time, calls 
FROM pg_stat_statements 
ORDER BY mean_time DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```
